;;; Commentary:
;;
;; A generic interface for communication with PipeWire (https://pipewire.org).
;; It abstracts communication with PipeWire to be backend independent.
;; Only functions from this module may communicate with PipeWire.
;;
;; Currently, pw-cli is used to talk to PipeWire.  This is not optimal
;; because pw-cli doesn't seem to have documented output format and
;; the format changes accross PipeWire versions.  But there seem to be
;; no better options currently.  This module should allow switching to
;; other communication means easily, without any changes needed
;; outside this module, except for using a different communication
;; class.

It is a list of object data.  Each of the elements has a form
\(OBJECT-ID . INFO) where OBJECT-ID is a numeric OBJECT-ID as
reported by PipeWire and INFO is an association list of items
\(NAME . VALUE) where NAME is a string item name as reported by
PipeWire and VALUE is the corresponding value.  VALUE is a number for
object ids, a string otherwise.
A special entry with `type' symbol as its name contains the PipeWire
type of the objects, as a string (e.g. \"Device\", \"Node\", \"Port\",
 \"Client\", ...).
CLASS is a PipeWire interface, see symbol `pw-accessor'.")

NODE-ID is a numeric PipeWire Node id (other kinds of PipeWire objects
are not supported in this method).
Object properties may be, unlike object info items, settable.

An assocation list is returned.  Each list element is of the form
\(PROPERTY . VALUE) where PROPERTY is a string name of the given
property.  VALUE can be:

- \"true\" or \"false\" for boolean values (t and nil are not used to
  avoid confusion with nil representing invalid or unavailable value).
- A number for numeric values (ids, integers, floats).
- A string for string values.
- A list of elements of any of these types for arrays and structs.

the properties to be changed.
